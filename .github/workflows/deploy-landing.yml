# NOTE: This workflow is for reference only!
# GitHub Pages only allows ONE site per repository.
#
# Since we're using GitHub Pages for the docs (docs.redstone-dart.dev),
# the landing page should be deployed elsewhere:
#
# Options for hosting the landing page (redstone-dart.dev):
# 1. Cloudflare Pages (recommended - free, fast, easy)
# 2. Vercel (free for personal projects)
# 3. Netlify (free tier available)
# 4. Separate GitHub repo: redstone-dart.github.io
#
# To use Cloudflare Pages:
# 1. Connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages
# 2. Set build command: cd packages/landing && npm install && npm run build
# 3. Set output directory: packages/landing/dist
# 4. Add custom domain: redstone-dart.dev
#
# Below is a sample workflow if you create a separate repo for landing:

name: Deploy Landing (Reference Only)

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - 'packages/landing/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages-landing"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: packages/landing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: packages/landing/dist

  # This deploy step won't work because docs already uses GitHub Pages
  # Keeping for reference if you move to a separate repo
  # deploy:
  #   environment:
  #     name: github-pages
  #     url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   needs: build
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  #       id: deployment
  #       uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
